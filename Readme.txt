Everybody knows it's hard to get an appointment at a BLS office.
Created a code that throws alert if appointment is open.

Install npm, nodeJs

- https://docs.npmjs.com/downloading-and-installing-node-js-and-npm


Go to the project in CMD or terminal
- type command and run
`npm run show_appointment_dates_passport_brampton`


The code runs in a loop and checks if there are any dates opened at brampton location.
If any date is opened, the code will throw an alert on screen.
